# KTB Kiteboarding School

# Goal for this Project
Welcome to KTB Kiteboarding School. This school provides an outlet for all people desiring adrenalin to get involved and give kiteboarding a go. 

This site gives some information about the school, basic information about kiteboarding and school events to capture the eye of a potential member. It also gives the ability to make contact with the school easily through social media or directly via the contact form.

## Design Choices

### Fonts

### Icons

### Colours


![Colour Pallet](wireframes/new-colour-pallet.JPG)

### Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are :

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the school, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:

### [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes/T4Tri_desktop.png "Desktop wireframe")
### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/T4Tri_tablet.png "Tablet wireframe")
### [Phone Wireframe](wireframes/T4Tri_phone.png "Phone wireframe")

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily and the club logo which doubles as a link back to the home screen.

+ Desktop (>=992px)
\
&nbsp;
    ![Navigation bar](wireframes/nav-bar-desktop.JPG)
    -   Spanning the full width of the device and with all links (Home, About, Events, Contact) to navigate visible, this gives ease and clear use to the end user.

    -   In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a bar below the text.

    ![Navigation bar on hover](wireframes/nav-bar-hover.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;
    -   For the user to know that a link has been clicked there is also a visual aid of the bar changing colour.

    ![Navigation bar on focus](wireframes/nav-bar-focus.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;

+ Small devices (<992px)
\
&nbsp;
    - As the navigation bar would be unuseable in the desktop version on smaller devices, it takes on a hamburger style.

    \
    &nbsp;
![Nav bar on small devices](wireframes/nav-bar-small.JPG)

    - When pressed, it opens up the main menu with all the links available then.
