## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen 
[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?query=rub "Rubik font"). as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out form the text, I decided to use [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=bar "Barlow font"). This font is complimentary to Lato but gives clear definition between text and headers.

### Icons
I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, social media links, contact links and a nav bar icon links on all devices. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

### Colours
I have used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "canva") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I selected the initial colour that I wanted the reast of my pallet to fit with and then used the generator to create the pallet.

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.

![Colour Pallet]

* #050833 - This colour will be used as a text colour also for the icons colour.
* #75E6DA - This colour will be used as a logo colour and nav bar icon background colour.
* #fafafa - This colour will be used as background colour for features and about section.
* #efefef - This colour will be used as background colour for events and contact section.


### Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |
