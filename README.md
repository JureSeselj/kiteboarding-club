# KTB Neretva Club

# Goal for this Project
Welcome to KTB Kiteboarding Club. This club provides an outlet for all people desiring adrenalin and sport activity to get involved and give kiteboarding a go. 

This site gives some information about the club, basic information about kiteboarding and club events to capture the eye of a potential member. It also gives the ability to make contact with the club easily through social media or directly via the contact form.

## Design Choices

### Fonts

### Icons

### Colours


![Colour Pallet](wireframes/new-colour-pallet.JPG)

### Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are :

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the school, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:

### [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes/T4Tri_desktop.png "Desktop wireframe")
### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/T4Tri_tablet.png "Tablet wireframe")

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily and the club logo which doubles as a link back to the home screen.

+ Desktop (>=992px)
\
&nbsp;
    ![Navigation bar](wireframes/nav-bar-desktop.JPG)
    -   Spanning the full width of the device and with all links (Home, About, Events, Contact) to navigate visible, this gives ease and clear use to the end user.

    -   In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a bar below the text.

    ![Navigation bar on hover](wireframes/nav-bar-hover.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;
    -   For the user to know that a link has been clicked there is also a visual aid of the bar changing colour.

    ![Navigation bar on focus](wireframes/nav-bar-focus.JPG)
    \
    &nbsp;

+ Small devices (<992px)
\
&nbsp;
    - As the navigation bar would be unuseable in the desktop version on smaller devices, it takes on a hamburger style.

    \
    &nbsp;
![Nav bar on small devices](wireframes/nav-bar-small.JPG)

    - When pressed, it opens up the main menu with all the links available then.

### Landing Page

+ The landing page image
    - The image gives the user instant knowledge of what is involved in the school, and with added animation draws their eye to the site.
    - The text gives instant information to the user on what the school is. With the added animation of fading in slightly behind the image, it makes the user keep interest.

# Testing

I feel that the site has hit the goals required by all parties. The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes with very little, large blank spaces. It allows the user to navigate around easily and aslo make contact via the contact form or social media simply. It The content is simple and to the point and the site is not overcrowded as to put the user off.
\
&nbsp;

I have encountered several issues during testing. 
 + I initially decided to create the site with a minimum width of 992px as my largest styling, however the site just did not look right so added an x-large screen size.

 + In my wireframes, I had designed to only have a 'Join Us' button on the larger screen sizes. While I was developing the site, this did not make sence. There was such a long scroll with it being a one-page site, I felt I needed to speed up the movement for someone who was instantly interested so included it on all screen sizes.

 + On actual smaller devices, instead of on Chrome Developer, the main navigation menu did not show the 'Contact' link. I simply changed the styling of the links and the changed the ul to flex-start and all is now clearly visable.

 + I was having issues with the navigation bar scrolling about 15px when I scrolled down on smaller devices whilst working on Chrome Developer. I lost a lot of time trying to figure out the issue, but when I tried the site on an acual device, the navigation bar stayed fixed as the code dictated. This was a bug in Chrome Developer and not with my site.

 + The main navigation on smaller devices was initially set to 90vh, however on testing on a physical device, the user could see the site scrolling at the bottom if they were to slide up or down. This looked very poor and clumsy on the eye, so I adjusted it to 100vh to cover it up.

 + I found that I was repeating alot of code in my style.css file in order to center items. I created a class to do this and then applied it whee needed.

 + All my buttons were styled completly differently. I added an animation to all buttons so there is a continuity between them all.

 + When I was validating HTML code, I had one error showing. This was in the contact form where I had a method of '#'. I was under the understanding that POST method should have been used, but when I did, it caused an error instead of going to my contact.html page. After a while I tried using GET and it worked solving my validation problem. The results of my validation for HTML and CSS are below.

    - HTML (index.html) validator [results](wireframes/html-validate.JPG "W3C HTML")
    - HTML (contact.html) validator [results](wireframes/html-contact-validate.JPG "W3C HTML")
    - CSS validator [results](wireframes/css-validate.JPG "W3C CSS")
\
&nbsp;

## Unfixed Bugs

My learning has limited my use of the hamburger for smaller devices. It works nicely to open the menu up, but a tap of the hamburger again should close the menu down again. It does not do this, and the link has to be selected to enable the user to exit out of it. From my research it seems that all the streamline methods are using JavaScript and I am yet to learn this.
