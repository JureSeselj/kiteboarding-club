## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen 
[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?query=rub "Rubik font"). as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out form the text, I decided to use [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=bar "Barlow font"). This font is complimentary to Lato but gives clear definition between text and headers.

### Icons
I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, social media links, contact links and a nav bar icon links on all devices. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

### Colours
I have used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "canva") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I selected the initial colour that I wanted the reast of my pallet to fit with and then used the generator to create the pallet.

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.

![Colour Pallet]

* #050833 - This colour will be used as a text colour.
* #75E6DA - This colour will be used as a vertical navigation bar background colour and as a button background colour on banner page.
* #735E93 - This colour will be used as text colour also button background colour on about us section.
* #fafafa - This colour will be used as background colour for about us section and events section.
* #efefef - This colour will be used as background colour for features section and contact section.


### Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are:

| Screen Size | Devices            | Breakpoint    |          
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| X-Small     | portrits phones    |  320px and up |
| Small       | landscape phones   |  576px and up |
| Medium      | tablets            |  768px and up |        
| Large       | desktops           |  992px and up |        
| X-Large     | large desktops     | 1200px and up |
| XX-Large    | larger desktops    | 1400px and up |
